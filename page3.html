                What type of earth would our future generation live in if we can't control Climate change?
            </h1>
            I think Climate change is one of the most discussed topic recently after the Coronavirus Pandamic and rightly so because it a very 
            serious topic that needs a lot more attention than it is getting. Our world is facing a very dangerous situation i.e. The Pandamic
            but were facing another problem as well and that could bring about catastropic damage to earth's ecosystem and we human beings as a 
            species homeless. <br>
            Climate change has many severe consequence for the world to face. It has many social and economic challanges for any country of the world
            . The social infractures of a country will be worthless in front of the climate challanges global warming brings forth . Some of the major
            problems that our future generation will have to face due to increasing global tempereture are :
           <ul> <li>
                Threat of sinking for low lying countries.</li>
                <li>Change in climate patterns may cause the agriculture system to fail.</li>
                <li>Poor countries' infrestructure will fail against drastic and dramatic calamities that climate change invites.</li>
                <li>Human resources will not be able to adapt to the quickly changing climate.</li>
                <li>Countries which lack the technologies to coup up with such terrible conditions will get the worst of it.</li>
        </ul>

        The above images give only minor ideas what problems we are going to face if climate change goes on the same rate. We have to take 
        immediate actions to control Climate change and global warming or else we are in serious trouble. There are many ways to fight climate
        change and we should do everything from our side to minimize the effects of it.
